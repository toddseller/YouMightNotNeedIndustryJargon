# You Might Not Need Industry Jargon

Industry jargon, and its cousins are great, and by all means use them if want to sound like a douche.

If you're working in the tech industry, on the other hand, please take a moment to consider if you actually need to use Industry jargon. Maybe you can include a few choice words, and forgo the requirement. If you're only targeting more modern language speakers, you might not need anything more than plain old English.
